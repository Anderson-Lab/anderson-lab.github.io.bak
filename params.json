We develop algorithms and software to tackle some of the most challenging and interesting data intensive problems in the life sciences. Our research interests include data science, big data, pattern analysis in high-dimensionality data sets, evolutionary computation and optimization, machine learning, computational genomics, cloud computing, computational metabolomics, and eScience. We currently have multidisciplinary projects underway in metabolomics, human cognition, toxicology, marine biology, medical genomics, biomedical informatics, and marine genomics.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## PI\r\nDr. Paul Anderson graduated in 2004 from Wright State University with a B.S. degree in Computer Engineering. He received his masters in Computer Science in 2006 and his Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering in June 2010. After graduation, Dr. Anderson was awarded a Consortium of Universities Research Fellowship to study as a Bioinformatics Research Scientist for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Dr. Anderson has published 24+ peer-reviewed articles in the fields of genomics, computational intelligence, metabolomics, e-Science, bioinformatics, cloud computing, cancer informatics, and computer science and engineering education. At present, Paul is an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at the College of Charleston. He is the director of the Data Science Program, the first such undergraduate program in the country. Dr. Anderson is the director of several specialized and complementary research groups: Charleston Computational Genomics Group (C2G2), Computational Metabolomics Group (CMG), Bioinformatics Research Group (BiRG), and the Data Science Research Group (DSRG). His research labs at the College of Charleston specialize in applying data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to the fields of bioinformatics, genomics, cancer informatics, and metabolomics. His lab develops algorithms and software to tackle some of the most challenging and interesting data intensive problems in the life sciences. Dr. Andersonâ€™s research interests include data science, big data, pattern analysis in high-dimensionality data sets, evolutionary computation and optimization, machine learning, computational genomics, cloud computing, computational metabolomics, and eScience. He currently has multidisciplinary projects underway in metabolomics, human cognition and fatigue, toxicology, marine biology, cancer informatics, and medical and marine genomics. Dr. Anderson is also the primary investigator for new Omics NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates at the College of Charleston (<a href=\"http://omics.cofc.edu\">http://omics.cofc.edu</a>).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
