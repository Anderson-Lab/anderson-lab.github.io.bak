We develop algorithms and software to tackle some of the most challenging and interesting data intensive problems in the life sciences. Our research interests include data science, big data, pattern analysis in high-dimensionality data sets, evolutionary computation and optimization, machine learning, computational genomics, cloud computing, computational metabolomics, and eScience. We currently have multidisciplinary projects underway in metabolomics, human cognition, toxicology, marine biology, medical genomics, biomedical informatics, and marine genomics.\r\n</p>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
